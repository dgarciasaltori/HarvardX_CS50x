## About The Project

This is a very simple and light tic tac toe web game made using HTML, CSS and JS. This game is very easy to play.

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game
for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of
their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play
from both players.
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in
the grid.

There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who
may not have discovered the optimal strategy.

When considering only the state of the board, and after taking into account board symmetries (i.e. rotations and reflections), there
are only 138 terminal board positions. A combinatorics study of the game shows that when "X" makes the first move every time, the
game outcomes are as follows:

91 distinct positions are won by (X)
44 distinct positions are won by (O)
3 distinct positions are drawn

Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and
the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program
to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830
possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the
game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.


Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing
tiles dating from around 1300 BC.

An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three
pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to
empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient
game is three men's morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish, and Picaria, a
game of the Puebloans.

The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "noughts and crosses" (nought being an alternative
word for 'zero'), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries. The first print reference to a game
called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, consisting of trying with the eyes
shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored".[quote citation needed] "Tic-tac-toe" may
also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The US renaming of "noughts and
crosses" to "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.

In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the
University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games. The computer player could play perfect games of
tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The Tinkertoy
computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently on display at the Museum
of Science, Boston.
